Use your projectStarter script to create a project named "W3C"
Connect your folder to Git/GitHub
Create the standard header, main footer layout
Include a logo in the top header
In the main include:
One "meet the team" section that contains 3 articles, with each article containing:
One image, one title and one paragraph
The paragraph should not show up on mobile but should on tablet and desktop
Hint - The CSS property display: none will help here
These articles should change their grid layout based on how much room is available horizontally.
One "our product" section that contains 2 articles, with each article containing:
One image and one paragraph.
On mobile and tablet the order of the articles should be image, paragraph, image paragraph
On desktop each article should be 2 columns:
One with the image on the left and text on the right
The other with the image on the right and text on the left
Hint: The order property will be very helpful here!
In the footer include:
Three columns. One for social media links, one for an email and phone button, the other for links to fake internal pages
These columns should stack vertically on smaller screens and spread horizontally on larger screens
Please use margin or padding at least twice to give some minor adjustments to spacing around elements on the page.
Once complete, add, commit, and push the files with the commit message "Added responsive media queries to style".
